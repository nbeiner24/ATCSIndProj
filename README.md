# ATCSIndProj
My final project for the 2024 Advanced Topics in CS course at Polytechnic School

Probably gonna make a game or something in Processing but will decide fully later.

# 5/10/2024
Decided to fully commit to recreating (part of) World 1-1 of the original super mario game.
Installed Processing and made some classes.

# 5/15/2024
Found out about pygame and decided to use that instead of processing
Set up a basic little display program and learned how to set an icon for the program window
(I used the star from super mario)
