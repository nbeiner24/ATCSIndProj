# ATCSIndProj
My final project for the 2024 Advanced Topics in CS course at Polytechnic School

Probably gonna make a game or something in Processing but will decide fully later.

# 5/10/2024
Decided to fully commit to recreating (part of) World 1-1 of the original super mario game.
Installed Processing and made some classes.

# 5/15/2024
Found out about pygame and decided to use that instead of processing
Set up a basic little display program and learned how to set an icon for the program window
(I used the star from super mario)

# 5/17/2024
Was supposed to make a commit today but computer died. Dove a bit into making an actual Sprite class.

# 5/19/2024
I realized partway through that this task is far more complicated than I originally made it out to be, so the program is honestly far more rudimentary and inefficient than I wanted it to be, in terms of both visuals and the code itself. I think that if I had a whole month I could actually recreate a 1:1 replica of the first level of the original Super Mario. I also was pretty busy during the week and weekend with AP's, prom, and my weekend job, but I still appreciate what I could do for the program :).

# FINAL WORDS
I really had fun learning pygame, and I think I might either continue this project or start a new one over the summer, because I really like how intuitive the pygame built-in methods are, and theres a really strong and beginner friendly community on Youtube and other areas of the internet. One thing that I regret doing is making my own sprite class because halfway through my project, things started becoming really ineficcient in terms of code, and I realized that pygame actually has its own built-in sprite class that probably would have made the project a little bit easier. There were two things that I wanted to add to my little demo but either couldn't figure out a solution or decided that my weird home-made Sprite class wouldn't allow me to go further.

The first is that I wanted to make the mario sprite change from the small pixel art to the large version. I have all the files in the folder, but I couldn't manage to try and get it to render the large version after consuming the mushroom. I think it's because once I created a player object, I couldn't edit the image that represented it, but I could be wrong.

I also wanted to make the basic black bars have the texture of actual Mario bricks, but I couldn't find a good texture on the internet. Additionally, I'm not sure how a set texture would work with varying sizes of rectangles, like the ones I had in the demo program.

Finally, the last thing I wanted to do with the demo was that I wanted to add animations to Mario and the Goomba, but as I was researching how to animate in pygame, I learned that not only do you need an image called a sprite sheet, which helps you animate easier, but all the sources I found were telling me how to do it by using pygame's built-in sprite class. As I said earlier, I made and used my own sprite class, so I ended up dropping the animation idea after an hour or so of research.

Again, just to paraphrase, I think pygame is really cool and I either want to finish this project or start another one over the summer. I know I made some mistakes along the way and was restricted by timing and my personal schedule :( , but now that I know more about pygame, I think I could actually make a good program with well thought-out functions and efficient coding.
